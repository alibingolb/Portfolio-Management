### Portfolio-Management
A few python files that I use for my own Porfolio. I will keep adding new ones.

# Dolar Cost Averaging
This python file is helpful when you got one stock/bond/coin... at different times as it gives the average cost that your buyings.

# Future Worth of Money
This python file helps you to estimate future worth of your investment by taking the term, your initial money and the compound by using simple formula F = P(1+i)^n (where p~ present value of your money, i ~ the compound in 0.xx format, n ~ the term)
